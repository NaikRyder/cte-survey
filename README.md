Survey Data Transformation Readme
Overview
This readme provides instructions on how to transform survey data from students, where responses to various psychological questions are converted into numerical data. The purpose of this data transformation is to facilitate quantitative analysis and gain insights into the psychological aspects of the surveyed students.

Steps for Data Transformation
Data Collection:

Collect survey data from students. Ensure that the survey includes a variety of psychological questions, covering different aspects such as emotions, stress levels, motivation, etc.
Data Format:

Make sure the survey data is organized in a structured format, preferably in a spreadsheet (e.g., CSV, Excel). Each row should represent a student, and columns should represent different survey questions (refer the Likert Scale if needed).

Check for missing or incomplete responses. Decide on a strategy for handling missing data, such as imputation or removal of incomplete records.
Scaling and Normalization:

Consider scaling and normalizing numerical data if responses are on different scales. This ensures that all features contribute equally to the analysis.
Data Validation:

Validate the transformed data to ensure accuracy. Check for outliers and anomalies in the dataset.
Documentation:

Document the encoding scheme used, any assumptions made during data transformation, and details of the scaling or normalization process. This documentation is crucial for reproducibility and understanding the dataset.
Data Storage:

Save the transformed data in a separate file, preserving the original survey data for reference. Choose a file format that suits the analysis tools used.
